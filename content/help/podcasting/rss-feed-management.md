# RSS Feed Management

Every show in Radio Suite automatically generates a compliant RSS feed suitable for distribution to major platforms like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.

## Accessing Your Feed

To find the RSS feed URL for a show:
1.  Navigate to the **Shows** page.
2.  Find the show you want to distribute.
3.  Click the **Feed** button (RSS icon).
4.  A modal will appear with your unique **Feed URL**.

## Feed Metadata

To ensure your podcast is accepted by directories, your show must have complete metadata. You can edit this by clicking the **Edit** button on the show card.

**Required Fields:**
- **Title:** The name of your podcast.
- **Description:** A summary of your show.
- **Cover Image:** Must be at least 1400x1400 pixels and square.
- **Author:** The person or organization responsible for the podcast.
- **Email:** A contact email for the podcast owner (required for Apple Podcasts).
- **Category:** The primary iTunes category (e.g., "Music", "Technology").
- **Language:** The language code (e.g., "en-us").
- **Explicit:** Mark as "Yes" if your content contains explicit language.

## Validating Your Feed

Before submitting your feed, it is highly recommended to validate it to ensure there are no errors.

1.  Copy your **Feed URL**.
2.  Visit a validator service like [Podbase](https://podba.se/validate/) or [Cast Feed Validator](https://castfeedvalidator.com/).
3.  Paste your URL and run the validation.

## Distributing Your Podcast

Once your feed is valid, you can submit it to directories:

- **Apple Podcasts:** Submit via [Apple Podcasts Connect](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/).
- **Spotify:** Submit via [Spotify for Podcasters](https://podcasters.spotify.com/).
- **Google Podcasts:** Automatically indexed, but you can use Google Podcasts Manager.

> [!NOTE]
> It may take up to 24 hours for new episodes to appear on these platforms after you publish them in Radio Suite, as they cache your RSS feed.

# Editing Episodes

You can edit any published episode to update its details or replace the audio file. These changes will automatically reflect in your RSS feed.

## Accessing the Editor

1.  Navigate to the **Episodes** page.
2.  Click the **Manage Episodes** button on the show card.
3.  Find the episode you want to edit in the drawer.
4.  Click the **Edit** (pencil) icon.

## Updating Metadata

In the "Edit Episode" modal, you can change:

- **Title & Description:** Update the text that appears in podcast apps.
- **Episode/Season Numbers:** Organize your content.
- **Explicit Content:** Toggle the explicit flag if the episode contains mature content.
- **Host Override:** Set a specific host for this episode (different from the show default).

## Replacing Audio

If you need to fix an audio issue or upload a new version:

1.  In the Edit Episode modal, look for the **Audio File** section.
2.  Click **Replace Audio**.
3.  Upload your new MP3 or AAC file.
4.  The system will automatically update the duration and file size in your feed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replacing the audio file is permanent. The old file will be deleted from the server.

## Unpublishing

To remove an episode from your public feed without deleting it entirely:
- Currently, you must **Delete** the episode to remove it. Unpublishing is coming in a future update.

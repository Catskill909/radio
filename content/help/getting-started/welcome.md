# Welcome to Radio Suite

Radio Suite is a comprehensive radio station management system that helps you schedule shows, record audio, and distribute podcasts — all from one beautiful interface.

## What You Can Do

### Show Management
Create and organize your radio shows with complete metadata for podcast distribution. Each show can have its own artwork, description, hosts, and RSS feed.

### Smart Scheduling
Use the visual calendar to schedule shows with drag-and-drop ease. Set up recurring shows that automatically extend into the future, preventing scheduling conflicts.

### Automated Recording
Connect to Icecast streams and automatically record your broadcasts. Recordings are captured at scheduled times without manual intervention.

### Podcast Publishing
Recordings automatically become podcast episodes with iTunes-compatible RSS feeds. Distribute to Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast platforms.

### Audio Quality Control
Configure encoding settings per-show or globally. Choose codec, bitrate, sample rate, and VBR/CBR settings for optimal quality.

## Key Concepts

### Station Timezone
Radio Suite uses a **single station timezone** for all scheduling and recording. This ensures everyone sees the same time regardless of their location. Set your timezone in Settings.

### Shows
A **Show** is a program you broadcast (e.g., "Morning Coffee Talk", "Evening Jazz Hour"). Shows have:
- Title, description, and category
- Host information and artwork
- Recording configuration
- RSS feed for podcast distribution

### Schedule Slots
A **Schedule Slot** is a specific time when a show airs (e.g., "Morning Coffee Talk on Monday at 8 AM"). Slots can be:
- One-time events
- Recurring weekly shows
- Edited individually or in bulk

### Recordings
A **Recording** is the captured audio from a broadcast. The system:
- Starts automatically at scheduled time
- Records from configured Icecast stream
- Saves with quality metadata
- Can auto-publish as episode

### Episodes
An **Episode** is a published recording available in your podcast feed. Episodes have:
- Custom title and description
- Episode/season numbers
- Publication date
- Audio file link

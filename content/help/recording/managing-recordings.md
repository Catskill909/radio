## Recording Statuses

- **Recording:** The show is currently on air and being recorded.
- **Completed:** The show has finished, and the file is ready.
- **Failed:** An error occurred (usually stream disconnection).
- **Pending:** Scheduled for the future.

## Actions

Click the **Play** button on any completed recording to listen to it in the browser.

### Publishing
To turn a recording into a podcast episode:
1.  Click the **Publish** button.
2.  Fill in the episode details (Title, Description, etc.).
3.  Click **Publish Episode**.
The recording will now appear in your RSS feed.

### Deleting
